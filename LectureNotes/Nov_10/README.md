### Morning Discussion
  1. Student Success:
     - overload of material of both Docker and Apache
     - need to get use to work under vague instructions
     - difficult to get started on various pieces of an assignment
     - don't know how to break things down into appropriate steps and to triage our own process
     - other CIT classes did not provide stuff you expect us to know ***
     - Fitzgerald has _*HIGH*_ expectations, yet we have been allowed to set lower expectations
        * Big mismatch in expectations between the Prof and Students
     - CIT160 lab structure provided a step by step, we don't have that here
        * (Prof's note: But CIT160 is a freshman class, and this is a Senior Class)

### Afternoon Discussion
  1. Student Success:
     - Big mismatch in expectations between the Prof and Students
     - Various classes have very different material, and 
       * no one reenforces or leverages the previous class material 
     - This class as *ALL* new material
     - Missing information that we should have had
       * reg expressions
       * DNS
       * steps that are taken by a server
       * scripting practice 
       * Source Control Systems (e.g., git)
       * command line...

  1. My Goal associated with CIT384:
     - push and drive 
  1. Class Observations:
     - at least two definitive groups within the class
